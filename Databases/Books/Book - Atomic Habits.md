## Noter
- systems over goals. Goals are What you want to achieve, systems or the processes that you need to establish to reach your goals. 
- Goals are good for setting a direction. Systems are good for making progress towards the goal
- The purpose of goals is to win the game. The purpose of systems is to continue playing the game.
- You do not rise to the level of your goals. You Fall to the level of your systems
- Identity based habits focus on who we need to become to reach our goals. If you still believe you are a smoker, you will most likely continue to smoke
- Some actions and habits are impossible under a certain set of beliefs
- If you identify as a gymbro or a fit person, you are more likely to go to the gym and workout because it is part of your identity
- A habit consists of a cue, craving, response, reward. These all come together for the habit to happen Altså [[4 Laws of behavior change]]
	- cue: you get a notification
	- Craving: you want to check the notification
	- Response: you check the notification
	- Reward: you feel satisfied that you checked the notification

## Noter
### The Eudaimonia machine (Deep work machine)
https://holtbyturner.co.uk/the-eudaimonia-machine-designing-productivity/. Described on the book.
David Dewane’s creation of the Eudaimonia Machine nurtures deep work through a one-storey rectangular building made up of five rooms, where you can only go from one to another, and not e.g. from 3 to 5
#### The Gallery, Room One
“The gallery is about positive peer pressure,” Dewane says. Walking in off the street, employees enter the Gallery. Supposedly a space that inspires through examples of deep work produced by [the organisation within] the machine. The Gallery provides encouragement and motivation.

#### The Salon, Room Two 
This is a room with a relaxed atmosphere, encouraging socialising, communication and discussion of ideas. This room has quality coffee machines, and other consumables, to help you relax before and after Deep work sessions 

#### The Office, Room Three
In the middle comes the Office, with desks nestled around a couple of large tables, in what we typically think of as a modern open-plan office. Designed to feel laid-back, this is where ‘shallow work’ (Chores, and tasks) is done, with a friendly and collegiate atmosphere. Here you will also find a management desk, with someone or something to help delegate Tasks to you.

#### The Library, Room Four
This is what Dewane calls the “hard drive of the machine” – a quiet space for research and thought gathering. Organised with books, archives of work done previously. Kind of a second brain for your work. This is the perfect prep for the final room where deep work begins. 

#### The Chamber, Room Five
This small, soundproof room is designed for “deep work”. Cut off from distraction and interruption, the Chamber affords employees the space and peace to do their finest work. It is here that long-term value is created for the individual worker, and for their organisation. You will do 60-90 minutes of uninterrupted and focused work, before taking a 30-90 min break in another room, before then doing 1-2 more rounds of deep work and rest. Since 2-3 deep work sessions of 90 minutes per day, with breaks in between is the supposed upper daily limit for full focus and effective work. Do more than 90 min then focus and efficiency falls off, do too little then you have less time of focused work, since it takes around 23 minutes to refocus after being distracted, and the clock resets every time you get distracted. Distracted meaning the distracting activity or notification takes as much or more brain activity to do/respond to than your deep work task. If you Take short breaks of 2-5 min of activities like meditation or eating a snack, inside the deep work session it doesn’t count as distraction, and doesn’t reset the clock. Sometimes it can be beneficial to take a short “non-distracting” break in your deep work sessions

**this machines layout is an abstract way of going about your deep work. With different zones/areas in your life dedicated to different activities and tasks**

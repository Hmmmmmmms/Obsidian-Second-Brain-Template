## Noter
Quote:: Create a Cult like following. Because it gives you leverage. Make people believe in a cause, because people need something to follow. A New course, religion og anything Else which people believe in will help Them. “In the absence of religion, your new belief system will bring you untold power”

Quote:: “So Much depends on reputation. Guard it with your life”, spread rumors about your enemies, because if they are proven to be false, doubt will still linger if they try so hard to dispute it.

Quote:: “Avoid the unhappy and unlucky. They are infectious”

Quote:: “Many of those pushing for equality, across the board, are actually employee a power strategy. Redistributing people’s rewards in a way that they determine. Judge and reward people on the quality of their work”

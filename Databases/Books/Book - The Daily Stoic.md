## Noter
Quote:: “it is not that we have a short time to live but that we waste much of it”

Quote:: “Be willing to learn from anyone and everyone, regardless of their station in life. Even Marcus Aurelius the emperor of Rome and the most powerfull man in the world sought to learn from Epictetus a former slave”

Quote:: “Your attention is one of your most valuable resources. In today’s society where every app, and every post wants your attention, it has become even more valuable. You will never complete all your task if you allow yourself to be distracted by every tiny interruption”

**Habits:**
Quote:: “We are what we repeatedly do, excellence is therefore not an act but a habit”
Quote:: “So are your habitual thoughts, so also will be the character of your mind” - Marcus Aurelius

Quote:: “How you do one thing is how you do everything. How you handle this day is how you handle every day, How you handle this minute is how you handle every minute
